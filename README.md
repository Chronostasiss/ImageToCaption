Image Captioning with CNN and LSTM
Overview

Image captioning is a fascinating area of research in artificial intelligence that combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques. It involves generating descriptive captions for images automatically, enabling machines to understand and communicate the content of visual data.

This project implements an image-to-caption generator using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence generation. The CNN extracts meaningful features from input images, while the LSTM generates coherent and contextually relevant captions based on those features.
How it Works

    Image Feature Extraction with CNN: The first step involves preprocessing the input images and passing them through a CNN, such as a pre-trained VGG16 or ResNet model. The CNN extracts high-level features from the images, capturing spatial information and object representations.

    Sequence Generation with LSTM: The extracted image features are then fed into an LSTM network. The LSTM processes the features sequentially and generates a caption word by word. At each time step, the LSTM predicts the next word in the caption based on the previously generated words and the visual context encoded in the image features.

    Training: The model is trained on a dataset of paired images and corresponding captions. During training, the goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the generated captions and the ground truth captions using techniques such as cross-entropy loss and gradient descent optimization.

    Inference: Once trained, the model can be used to generate captions for new unseen images. Given an input image, the model extracts features using the CNN and generates a caption using the trained LSTM decoder.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow or PyTorch (for CNN and LSTM implementations)
    Libraries for image preprocessing and natural language processing (e.g., OpenCV, NLTK)

Usage

    Data Preparation: Prepare a dataset of images paired with their corresponding captions for training.
    Model Training: Train the image captioning model using the provided training script or notebook.
    Inference: Use the trained model to generate captions for new images by running the inference script or notebook.
